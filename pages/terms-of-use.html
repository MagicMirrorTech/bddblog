				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>DISPUTE RESOLUTION; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</h3>
					<p>It is important that you read this entire section carefully. This section provides for resolution of disputes through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.</p>
					<h3>BINDING ARBITRATION</h3>
					<p>Any dispute, difference, controversy or claim between us or by either of us against the other or the employees, agents, mandataries, officers, directors, successors, assigns or affiliates of the other, arising out of, relating to, or having any connection with, the present terms, this website, any use of this website and any transaction conducted on or from it (whether contractual or extra-contractual, in contract or tort, pursuant to statute or regulation, or otherwise, and whether pre-existing, present or future), including any question regarding negotiation, formation, existence, validity, performance, effects, interpretation, breach, resolution or annulment and further including the applicability or scope of this arbitration clause (including the National Arbitration Forum’s Code of Procedure discussed below) (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Claims” and each, individually, as a “Claim”) shall be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration, to the exclusion of courts of law, before or under the rules of the National Arbitration Forum under the Code of Procedure then in effect and any specific procedures for the resolution of small claims and/or consumer disputes then in effect (which you may obtain at www.arbitration-forum.com or by mail at P.O. Box 50191, Minneapolis, MN 55405), which Code of Procedure, as in effect or replaced from time to time, is incorporated into and forms an integral part of these terms.
						<br /> <br />
						However, before you submit a Claim for arbitration, you must first contact our customer service representatives at help@magicmirror.dev, and give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. Similarly, before BDIT takes a dispute to arbitration, we must first attempt to resolve it by contacting you. If the dispute cannot be satisfactorily resolved within sixty (60) days from the date you or BDIT is notified by the other of a dispute, then either party may then initiate the arbitration process as provided in the National Arbitration Forum’s Code of Procedure.
						<br /> <br />
						For greater certainty, no recourse may be made by either party to any court or tribunal, whether federal or provincial, in respect of any matter whatsoever relating to these terms including, without limitation, any Claim, any arbitration initiated to resolve a Claim, and any arbitration award made in relation to a Claim, except as expressly permitted in these terms or by law. Any award rendered pursuant to the arbitration shall be final and binding on each of the parties and no appeal shall lie from such award. Such award may be rendered enforceable and executory by any court having jurisdiction over the person or the property of the person against whom enforcement of the award is sought.
						<br /> <br />
						No claim may be joined with another lawsuit, or in an arbitration with a dispute of any other person, or resolved on a class-wide basis. The parties expressly agree that any claim that is arbitrated pursuant to these terms shall not be consolidated with any other arbitral proceeding for any reason. The arbitrator may not award damages that are barred by these terms and may not award exemplary or punitive damages or attorneys' fees. You and BDIT both waive any claims for an award of damages that are excluded under these terms.</p>
						<h3>INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND PROVISIONAL RELIEF</h3>
						<p>Notwithstanding the provisions in this Section 17, the National Arbitration Forum’s Code of Procedure or any other provision of these terms, BDIT shall have the right to seek and obtain any injunctive, provisional or interim relief from any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its trade-mark or other intellectual property rights or confidential information or to preserve the status quo pending arbitration.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>CHANGES TO TERMS/SEVERABILITY</h3>
					<p>BDIT may modify, alter or otherwise update the terms applicable to this website from time to time. We will notify you of any such modifications to this website by posting notice of such changes on this website. Following the posting of such changes, your continued use of this site will constitute your acceptance of these terms and other policies, as modified. You will be bound by such changes. If any one of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, such condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>JURISDICTION</h3>
					<p>This website is controlled and operated by BDIT and makes no representation that materials on the website are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who choose to access this website from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>COOKIES</h3>
					<p>We may use “cookies” to track your preferences and activities on the BDIT website. Cookies are small data files saved by a website on your web browser. They keep a record of your preferences making your subsequent visits to the site more efficient. Cookies may store a variety of information, including, the number of times that you access a site, your registration information and the number of times that you view a particular page or other item on the site. The use of cookies is a common practice adopted by most major sites to better serve their clients. Most browsers are designed to accept cookies, but they can be easily modified to block cookies; see your browser’s help files for details on how to block cookies, how to know when you have received cookies and how to disable cookies completely. You should note, however, that without cookies, some of the website’s functions will not be available, and the user will lose some of the benefits of the site.
						<br /><br />
						We may share with certain partners information collected from our cookies placed on the BDIT website, such as your browsing activity on our websites and the products you purchase, to allow them to provide more relevant BDIT ads to you and provide us with measurement services, on an aggregated basis, on the efficiency of these ads. For the same purposes, we may allow the partners to place cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies on our website and use them to collect information about visitors of our website.
						<br /><br />
						You may also opt-out of the collection and use of your information for online behavioral advertising by visiting the following websites:
						http://www.aboutads.info/choices (United States),
						https://youradchoices.ca/choices/ (Canada) or
						http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ (European Union).
						<br /><br />
						To comply with the partner’s Business Tools Terms and the OPC’s position on OBA, BDIT may therefore be required to include more than a link to its Privacy Policy on its website. Some organizations comply with these requirements by placing a banner on their website to inform users that tracking cookies used for OBA will be placed on their browsers. Other organizations become members of the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (“DAAC”), which administers the “Your Ad Choice” program, and place the AdChoice logo on their website as a link to a dedicated page (i.e. outside of the privacy policy) explaining how visitors’ information is collected for ad purposes.
