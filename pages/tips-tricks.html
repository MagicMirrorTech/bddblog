            <p>
              The coronavirus pandemic has put businesses to the test like nothing ever has before and though many have found a way to rise to the challenge, uncertainty lingers in the air for most small and local businesses. At times, it feels that only corporate and large companies have the assets to survive, however, small businesses can compete with big companies when they use their own advantages in a smart manner.
              Here we’ve gathered 5 essential things small businesses should be doing right now:
            </p>

              <h3>Digitalize.</h3>
                <p>
                  With people trying to stay at home as much as possible and businesses not being able to operate to their normal capacity anytime soon. It is essential that you get your business up and running in a way that allows your customers to reach you easily and from their homes. Which means, getting a <em>functional and user friendly website, having your social media up to date, sharing your experience with the people that already love and support your business.</em>
                </p>

              <h3>Take care of your own.</h3>
                <p>
                  As a business, your working force is your motor oil and you need to take care of them. Their wellbeing will determine the overall health of your business. And as a business owner you need to make sure they are taken care of, not only in your business but also if you have people working from home. Their mental health is just as important and their physical health. This means, <em>allowing them to share their fears and frustration and you, being as transparent and honest as you can with them. It also means being able to provide them with hand sanitizer, masks, and applying measures to safeguard their health in their workspace.</em>
                </p>

              <h3>Partner to build resources.</h3>
                <p>
                  More than ever before powerful companies are partnering up in order to aid the global community to aid fighting the coronavirus. While your business may not have the resources Google or Apple have, there is a lot to learn from what they are doing.
                  As a small business you need to find a way to collaborate with your local businesses in order to support both the local economy and each other.
                  <em>Small businesses need to start thinking of each other as allies and not as competition.</em>
                </p>

              <h3>Support your local community.</h3>
                <p>
                  Chances are that if you are having a harder time than usual, so is most of your local community.
                  Remember that nothing <a href="./business.html#b-072820">builds your brand</a> better than giving back.
                  People want to see businesses that aren’t in it just for their own profit, they are interested in the ways that you are helping out those who are less fortunate than you are.
                  By supporting your local community by handing out masks or sanitizer, or even just finding ways to boost the local economy with discounts or deals. Or supporting nurses and doctors in whichever way you can. You are actively placing your company as one that cares for the people and not just making money.
                </p>

              <h3>Customer Care.</h3>
                <p>
                  Taking care of your customers is more important now than it has ever been. Chances are, that your customers are having an equally hard time adjusting to the new pandemic reality and they need all the support they can get from you, so make sure your company is there to show up 100%. Don’t make them feel abandoned or neglected. The customers you care for during these times will become brand ambassadors in the future
                </p>
